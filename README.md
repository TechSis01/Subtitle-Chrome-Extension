This Project will serve the purpose of translating Youtube videos that are recorded in other languages asides from English to English for the User.
We will be making use of a couple APIs :
The Microsoft traslation API https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/translator/business/trial/#get-started
This is the link to the Mircrosft translation API Documentation https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cognitive-services/translator/text-translation-overview
This is the link to the Google Chrome Extension API Documentation https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/reference/
The Youtube API https://developers.google.com/youtube/v3/getting-started

We need to register and do some authentication before we can make use of the microsoft translator API and the Youtube API
